playbookx: a library for writing simple OpenGL applications which are cross platform between RIM's PlayBook Tablet OS and desktop Linux. 

This was written for doing native OpenGL development for the PlayBook while rapidly testing on Linux. The idea is to write cross-platform OpenGL code (with the shared functions between desktop OpenGL and OpenGL ES) using a small library to wrap the platform-specific stuff. There's not much documentation, but a demo program is included in demo.c.

===============================================================================
Building the demo:

You'll need the BlackBerry Native SDK for Tablet OS 2.0 or later, GLUT developement headers, and libpng development headers.

Run "make" to create a Linux executable.

You'll need to edit some of the variables in Makefile to set the location of your SDK and details about your PlayBook. Run "make PLATFORM=playbook" to create a PlayBook executable, "make barname.bar PLATFORM=playbook" to create a BAR package, and "make deploy PLATFORM=playbook" to install the package on your device.

TODO:

 - smoother animation: my frame rate independent animation adds choppiness
 - text rendering
 - sound
 - orientation change
 - Playbook menu open event
 - better multitouch support
 - ???
